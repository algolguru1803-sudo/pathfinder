# ai-pathfinder

A long-running, multi-agent coding workflow for large/existing projects, packaged as a Claude Code
plugin. One command, `/feature`, drives a task from a rough idea to reviewed, implemented, and
documented code — while keeping a human comfortably in the loop through a **live per-task HTML
dashboard** and a single explicit approval gate (the plan).

## What it does

- **Autonomous exploration.** Spawns read-only `wf-explorer` sub-agents that map the relevant code
  (reading the project knowledge base first), so planning is grounded.
- **Human-friendly elaboration.** A per-task dashboard fills in as work proceeds. The human comments on
  individual plan blocks (Google-Docs style), answers open questions, queues up edits **in batches**,
  and clicks **«Отправить агенту на доработку»** — the agent picks the batch up at its next checkpoint
  and replies right in the page. One hard gate: **«Утвердить план»**.
- **Visual demos.** When a task warrants it, the planner generates 2–3 self-contained visual variants of
  the solution — interface **mockups** for UI work, an architecture **diagram/infographic** for
  backend/CLI — rendered inline in the dashboard (sandboxed) so the human can preview and **pick one**
  before any code is written.
- **Parallel implementation.** Spawns `wf-coder` sub-agents per work-stream, plus a `wf-documenter` that
  grows a durable, agent-readable knowledge base in `docs/knowledge/` as code lands.
- **Verification.** A `wf-reviewer` runs tests/linters/build and reviews the diff — and, for web UIs,
  drives a real browser via the bundled **Playwright** MCP. In VERIFY the orchestrator also runs the
  `/code-review` and `/security-review` skills as gates (re-runnable from the dashboard).
- **A control-panel dashboard.** Beyond the plan, the dashboard shows a **«Изменения»** tab (the task's
  git diff per file + the review findings), a **«Документация»** tab (the `docs/knowledge/` tree beside a
  live force-directed graph of how docs and code files link together, with this task's files highlighted),
  and a **chat panel** for free-form steering the agent picks up at checkpoints.
- **A flywheel.** Each task enriches `docs/knowledge/`, so the next task's exploration is faster.
- **Observability.** Bundled hooks trace each task as a span tree (sessions, phases, parallel
  sub-agents) and optionally forward it to **Langfuse**.

## Phases

`INTAKE → EXPLORE → ELABORATE → PLAN GATE → IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → DONE` — resumable across sessions via
`.workflow/tasks/<slug>/state.json`.

## `/new-product` — greenfield, from scratch

A second command, `/new-product`, drives a **brand-new product from a rough pitch** rather than a
change to an existing codebase. Where `/feature` starts by exploring code that already exists,
`/new-product` starts from nothing: it elicits requirements, writes a **PRD**, plans the build in
vertical-slice phases, then materializes the product through an **evolutionary build-loop** — sharing
the same companion server, dashboard, and telemetry as `/feature`.

Its stages are:

`INTAKE → DISCOVER → PRD → PRD-GATE → PHASE-PLAN → PLAN-GATE → BUILD → SHIP → DONE`

— resumable via the same `.workflow/tasks/<slug>/state.json`. (A *stage* is a workflow step; a *phase*
is a build slice inside BUILD.) On INTAKE the orchestrator bootstraps git for an empty repo (`git init`,
empty-tree base commit) so the **«Изменения»** tab works from the very first commit.

**How it differs from `/feature`:** `/feature` is for adding to or refactoring an **existing**
codebase and gates once on the plan; `/new-product` is **greenfield** — it produces a PRD first, gates
twice (PRD then phase-plan), and then runs an autonomous generate-and-judge loop to grow the product
slice by slice.

**Roles & models.** `/new-product` runs its own `np-*` sub-agent roster (model pinned per agent in
frontmatter) and reuses the workflow's reviewer/documenter:

| sub-agent       | model  | role                                                                |
|-----------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `np-thinker`    | fable  | ideation, PRD, phase goals, judge rubrics & test specs — works **only** from curated digests |
| `np-researcher` | opus   | gathers and **compresses** domain/stack facts into a research digest |
| `np-coder`      | opus   | tests-first then implementation; commits only via the orchestrator   |
| `np-judge`      | opus   | scores a slice against the PRD — one isolated call per rubric dimension |
| `wf-reviewer`   | —      | reused: code-review / security-review on SHIP                        |
| `wf-documenter` | —      | reused: grows the product's own `docs/knowledge/`                    |

The thinker is deliberately kept on **fable** and fed only curated digests (never raw sources): all
hand-offs go through the orchestrator, and sub-agents never spawn sub-agents.

**The evolutionary build-loop (in brief).** Each BUILD phase runs a loop: `np-coder` first materializes
**executable tests** from the thinker's spec (without seeing the implementation plan), and those tests
are **frozen** (paths + hashes in state). Then each iteration: implement → run the frozen tests →
if green, spawn three parallel `np-judge` calls (one per rubric dimension) → merge their verdicts. The
gate is **hybrid** — the tests are a wall (red tests never close a phase, and the judge isn't even
called), the judge is the steering wheel (3 dimensions × a 0–3 scale, `PASS_THRESHOLD = 80/100`, no
dimension at 0). A `decision()` step the orchestrator computes **deterministically** (not an LLM) ends
each iteration in one of: PASS, REFINE, or one of three **stop conditions** — budget exhausted (≤5
iterations/phase), a score plateau, or oscillation — which park for a human choice.

**Gate policy (V1).** Two human gates — **PRD-GATE** and **PLAN-GATE** — and then the build-loop is
**autonomous**: phases advance without a per-phase gate, escalating to the human only when a stop
condition fires. Both gates reuse the dashboard's existing **«Утвердить план»** signal; the
orchestrator interprets it by the current stage (PRD approved vs. phase-plan approved).

## Layout

```
.claude-plugin/   plugin.json, marketplace.json
.mcp.json         bundled MCP servers (playwright, context7)
hooks/hooks.json  telemetry hooks wiring
skills/feature/   the /feature orchestrator skill + reference files
skills/new-product/  the /new-product orchestrator skill + reference files
agents/           wf-explorer, wf-planner, wf-coder, wf-reviewer, wf-documenter, np-* (thinker, researcher, coder, judge)
scripts/          server.py (feedback server) + telemetry_hook.py + _aipf.py (shared, stdlib)
templates/        dashboard.html + Russian artifact & knowledge-base templates
evals/            fixtures, scenarios, rubrics for measuring the workflow
```

## Install

From GitHub (anyone):

```
/plugin marketplace add TiltCoding/pathfinder
/plugin install ai-pathfinder@tiltcoding
```

Or from a local checkout during development:

```
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/pathfinder
/plugin install ai-pathfinder@tiltcoding
```

Then run `/feature <describe your task>` in any project. The plugin starts the companion server, opens a
dashboard for the task, and walks the phases. Per-task scratch lives in `.workflow/` (gitignored); the
knowledge base in `docs/knowledge/` is meant to be committed.

## Conventions

- Artifacts, the dashboard, and the knowledge base are written in **Russian**; the skill/agent
  instructions are in **English** (more reliable triggering).
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` locates the server and templates at runtime.

## Telemetry & MCP

**Bundled MCP servers** (`.mcp.json`, launched via `npx` on demand):
- **playwright** (`@playwright/mcp`) — the reviewer drives a real browser in VERIFY for web changes.
  The browser launches lazily, only on the first browser call.
- **context7** (`@upstash/context7-mcp`) — the explorer/planner fetch up-to-date library docs.
  Works without a key (rate-limited); set `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` for higher limits.

**Telemetry hooks** (`hooks/hooks.json` → `scripts/telemetry_hook.py`) append a span tree to
`.workflow/tasks/<slug>/telemetry.jsonl`: a span per `/feature` session and per sub-agent (parallel
sub-agents are siblings — the branching view), tagged with phase/iteration. The **trace id is the task
slug**, so a task is one trace across sessions. Hooks only touch local disk (fast, never block tools).

The dashboard's **«Трейсинг»** tab visualizes this per task: a session summary (sub-agents, output
tokens, total time, peak context, ≈cost), a parallelism timeline (one lane per concurrent sub-agent),
and a card per sub-agent with model, duration, tokens, context-window fill %, cache-hit %, and ≈cost.
It is served by `GET /trace?slug=`, computed by joining the telemetry spans with per-sub-agent
**transcript** usage on disk (`~/.claude/projects/.../subagents/agent-*.jsonl`) — only numbers are
read, never prose. The same token/cost data also enriches the Langfuse generations.

The companion server forwards new events to **Langfuse** in the background (cursor-based, at-least-once)
when these env vars are set — otherwise it stays **local-only**:

| Env var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` | Langfuse public key (forwarding off if unset) |
| `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` | Langfuse secret key (forwarding off if unset) |
| `LANGFUSE_HOST` | Langfuse base URL (default `https://cloud.langfuse.com`) |
| `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` | Optional Context7 key for higher doc-fetch limits |

Disable forwarding explicitly with `server.py --no-forward`. **Note:** hook payloads carry no token
data, so structure/timing/outcomes come from the hooks while per-sub-agent token & context numbers are
recovered separately from the on-disk transcripts (see the «Трейсинг» tab above).

## Dashboard tabs

The per-task page is a control panel, served by the stdlib companion server (no build step, no CDN):

- **Рабочий процесс** — the plan, questions, visual demos and work-streams; the human comments and
  approves here.
- **Изменения** — the task's changed files (working tree diffed against the `baseCommit` captured at
  INTAKE) with `+/−` counts and per-file unified diffs (`GET /changes`), plus the **code-review /
  security-review** runs (`reviews.json`) with ranked findings and buttons to re-run either skill.
- **Документация** — the `docs/knowledge/` file tree beside a vanilla force-directed SVG graph
  (`GET /knowledge`) of how docs link to each other and to code files; nodes this task touched are
  highlighted, and clicking one opens the doc inline.
- **Трейсинг** — the observability view (see below).
- **💬 Чат** — a slide-in panel for free-form steering. Messages wake the agent via a `chat` signal and
  are answered at the next checkpoint (it never interrupts a running coder).

## Evaluations

Workflow quality is measured by reusing the **skill-creator** eval toolchain against fixture projects
(with-workflow vs vanilla baseline), so you can compare component variants with variance analysis. See
`evals/run-eval.md`.

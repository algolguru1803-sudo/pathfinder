# Feedback loop — companion server + batched checkpoints

The human and you communicate through a small local server and the per-task dashboard. The human can
write comments **any time**; you read them **only at checkpoints**, in batches. This keeps you from
polling during active work and gives the human a calm "queue up edits, then send" experience.

## Starting the server (once per project)

The server is `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/server.py` (stdlib only). Start it **in the background**
from the project root so it survives across your turns:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/server.py" --root "$(pwd)" >/dev/null 2>&1
```

Run it with the Bash tool using `run_in_background: true`. It writes `.workflow/server.json` with the
chosen `port` and `url` — read that file to learn the port (it auto-picks a free port near 8473). If
`server.json` already exists and `GET /health` answers, reuse it instead of starting another.

Then per task:
1. Copy `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/dashboard.html` → `.workflow/tasks/<slug>/index.html`.
2. Give the human the URL: `http://localhost:<port>/?slug=<slug>`.

The dashboard renders from `dashboard.json` and `replies.json`, which **you** write (see
`dashboard-guide.md`). The server persists the human's side: `draft.json` (accumulating),
`submissions/<n>.json` (a sent batch), `signals.json` (e.g. `approve-plan`), `submit.flag`.

## Signals the dashboard can raise

`signals.json` is an append-only log; the buttons in the dashboard `POST /signal` to it and wake your
`/wait`. Recognized signals:

- **`approve-plan`** — the human approved the plan at the gate (freeze `plan.md`, advance to IMPLEMENT).
- **`run-code-review`** / **`run-security-review`** — re-run that review skill over the current diff and
  append a fresh entry to `reviews.json` (see VERIFY in `phases.md`). Safe to receive in any phase;
  honor it at your next checkpoint.

`reviews.json` shape (you write it; the **«Изменения»** tab renders it):

```json
{ "runs": [
  { "id": "r1", "kind": "code-review", "status": "done", "ts": "...",
    "summary": "Краткий итог.", "findings": [
      { "severity": "high", "file": "src/x.py", "line": 42, "text": "…" } ] } ] }
```

## Parking at a checkpoint and consuming a batch

When you reach a checkpoint (end of an iteration where you want human input, or the plan gate):

1. Set `dashboard.json` status to `awaiting-batch` and write it. Tell the user in chat, briefly, that
   the dashboard is ready and they can comment and click «Отправить агенту на доработку» (or «Утвердить
   план» at the gate). Record your baselines in `state.json`: `lastSubmission = submit.flag.latest`
   and `lastSignalCount = len(signals.json.signals)`.
2. **Park on the long-poll, not a timer.** Read `url` from `.workflow/server.json` and start a
   **background** `curl` (Bash tool, `run_in_background: true`) on the `/wait` endpoint:

   ```bash
   curl -sS --max-time 1830 \
     "<url>/wait?slug=<slug>&sinceSubmission=<lastSubmission>&sinceSignal=<lastSignalCount>&timeout=1800" \
     || true
   ```

   `/wait` blocks until a new submission or signal lands and then returns instantly, so the harness
   re-invokes you **the moment the human clicks** — near-zero latency, no idle wake-ups. As a
   **fallback only**, also set a long `ScheduleWakeup` (~1850s, just past the curl timeout) with the
   same `/feature` prompt, in case the server or curl dies. If the human is clearly active in chat
   instead, just proceed from chat input.
   - On wake, read `.workflow/tasks/<slug>/submit.flag`. If `latest > lastSubmission`, read
     `submissions/<latest>.json` and process it (below).
   - Read `signals.json`. If an `approve-plan`, `run-code-review`, `run-security-review` (or other
     relevant) signal arrived past `lastSignalCount`, act on it; update `lastSignalCount`.
   - **Read `chat.jsonl`.** If there are `role:"human"` messages newer than `state.json.lastChatTs`,
     handle them (see «Chat» below); update `lastChatTs`.
   - If nothing new (a rare spurious return), re-park (repeat steps 1–2).
3. **Processing a submission:** for each item (`kind: "comment"` with `blockId`+`selectedText`, or
   `kind: "answer"` with `questionId`), apply the change to `plan.md`/`questions.md`/code as
   appropriate. A comment's `blockId` is the anchor of the commented region: a plan-block id (`b1`…),
   a prose-section anchor (`summary` / `codebaseMap`), **or** a demo-variant id (`variants[].id`, напр.
   `v2`) — у варианта теперь есть явное поле комментария, так что `comment` может прийти и на него;
   `selectedText` is the exact fragment the human highlighted (для коммента к варианту он обычно пустой)
   — use it to locate what they mean. Учти также, что `answer` по `questionId` может содержать **свободный
   текст вне `options`** (человек ответил своей формулировкой на choice-вопрос) — прими его как ответ, не
   отбраковывай. Then append a reply to `replies.json` keyed by
   the same `blockId`/`questionId` with a one- to two-sentence Russian note on what you did. Update `lastSubmission`, bump `iteration`,
   rewrite `dashboard.json` (status back to `working`, then to `awaiting-batch` for the next round).

`replies.json` shape:

```json
{ "replies": [
  { "blockId": "b1", "text": "Переименовал функцию в export_to_csv, обновил блок 1.", "ts": "..." },
  { "blockId": "v2", "text": "Учёл правку макета варианта B: подвинул сайдбар влево.", "ts": "..." },
  { "questionId": "q1", "text": "Принято: разделитель — запятая.", "ts": "..." }
] }
```

## Chat — free-form steering at checkpoints

Alongside the batched plan comments, the dashboard has a **chat panel** for free-form steering that
isn't tied to a plan block — questions, nudges, scope changes, "also do X". It coexists with batches;
it does **not** interrupt running coders. Handle it at checkpoints, the same cadence as everything else.

- Storage: `.workflow/tasks/<slug>/chat.jsonl`, append-only, one JSON object per line
  `{ "role": "human"|"agent", "text": "...", "ts": "...", "phase": "..." }`. A human message also raises
  a `chat` signal, so your parked `/wait` returns immediately.
- On wake (or at any IMPLEMENT checkpoint between work-streams), read messages with `ts >
  state.json.lastChatTs`. For each: answer it by **appending your own `role:"agent"` line** to
  `chat.jsonl` (the panel renders it), and if it asks for a change, fold it into the remaining
  work-streams / `plan.md` just like a steering batch. Then set `lastChatTs` to the newest message ts.
- Keep replies short and in Russian. If a request is large enough to reshape the plan, say so in chat
  and reflect it in `dashboard.json` rather than silently diverging.
- In headless/eval mode there is no chat; skip it.

## Don't busy-wait

The `/wait` long-poll is already the no-busy-wait path: you block on a background curl and are
re-invoked only when there's a real event, so you burn zero turns while parked and pick up clicks
near-instantly. Do **not** add a short-interval `ScheduleWakeup` to poll on top of it — keep only the
long (~1850s) fallback. If you are waiting on a long background coder instead of the human, you will
be re-invoked when it finishes — schedule only a long fallback in that case too.

## Eval / headless mode

With `--eval` / `AIPF_EVAL=1`: do not park for the human. If the fixture pre-seeded
`submissions/*.json`, apply them in order; then treat the plan as approved and continue. This is what
lets the workflow run unattended for benchmarking.

# Phases — what to do in each stage

Each stage ends by updating `state.json` (phase, iteration, checkpoint, improve-specific fields) and
`dashboard.json`. Spawn sub-agents with the Agent tool; pass them the slug and the absolute workspace
path. Keep the human's dashboard truthful at all times. The deep mechanics of CONSENSUS and DISPATCH
live in `consensus.md` — this file is the stage map that calls into it.

## 1. INTAKE

Goal: capture what we are auditing and stand up the workspace.

- Write `brief.md` from `templates/artifacts/brief.md`: the audit goal (what part of the app, what we
  want out of it), scope/non-scope, constraints (e.g. "only the dashboard", "no server changes"), and
  what the user already specified. Ask the user only for blockers you truly cannot infer — keep it
  light; this is an audit, not a single task, so the brief is a frame, not a spec.
- Create `state.json` (see `state-schema.md`) with `phase: "INTAKE"`, `iteration: 0`. In a git repo,
  record `baseCommit` = `git rev-parse HEAD`. Seed `prisms[]` with the default prism list (below) — or
  the subset the brief constrains you to.
- Start the companion server and copy the dashboard (see `feedback-loop.md`). Write the first
  `dashboard.json` (summary from the brief, status `working`) and give the user the URL.
- Advance to SCOUT.

## 2. SCOUT (autonomous)

Goal: survey the app from every prism and gather raw improvement candidates.

- Spawn **7 `wf-improver` agents in scout mode in parallel** — **one per prism**. The default prisms:
  1. **UX/продукт** — usability, flows, missing affordances, friction.
  2. **Производительность** — latency, big-O traps, wasteful work, payload size.
  3. **Надёжность/устойчивость** — error handling, edge cases, failure modes, recovery.
  4. **Качество кода/техдолг** — duplication, coupling, dead code, refactor opportunities.
  5. **DX** — developer experience: build/test/run ergonomics, docs, scripts.
  6. **Пробелы функциональности** — missing features users would reasonably expect.
  7. **Доступность + безопасность** — a11y gaps and security exposure (one combined prism).
  (Narrow the set if the brief constrains scope; keep them disjoint so scouts don't overlap.)
- Each scout **reads `docs/knowledge/INDEX.md` first** (reuse-first), then surveys the code from its
  prism, and returns a set of candidates in the structured per-candidate schema from `agents/wf-improver.md`
  (title / prism / problem with `path:line` / change / areas / size / risk / impact / rationale).
- You write each scout's raw output to `scout/<prism>.md` (one file per prism). Don't dedup yet — that
  is CONSENSUS.
- Update `dashboard.json` (a short "swarm in progress" summary), set `state.json.phase = "SCOUT"`,
  advance to CONSENSUS.

## 3. CONSENSUS (autonomous)

Goal: turn the raw scout output into a ranked, deduplicated, top-K shortlist.

- The full mechanics are in `consensus.md`: consolidate + **dedup** the scout candidates into stable
  `cand-1…cand-N` (`candidates.md`); spawn **3 `wf-improver` voters in parallel** (each sees the whole
  list, scores `impact/effort/risk/confidence` + keep/drop); then **you aggregate the scores
  deterministically** (the formula in `consensus.md` §aggregation) and sort to **top-K = 6–8**.
- Record `candidates[]`, `votes[]` (the aggregate per candidate), and the chosen top-K in `state.json`.
- Advance to PROPOSE/SELECT GATE.

## 4. PROPOSE / SELECT GATE (the one human gate)

Goal: present the top-K and let the human pick which features to dispatch. This is a batched-feedback
loop, exactly like `/feature`'s plan gate — but the gate is **feature-pick**, not plan-approve.

- Render the top-K into `dashboard.json` using the **feat-K contract** (see `dashboard-guide.md`
  §SELECT GATE): for each candidate `K`, write one `planBlocks[]` card and one
  `questions[kind:"choice"]`, **both with the same `id = feat-K`** and `options:["Делаем","Пропускаем"]`.
  The card `body` (markdown) carries: prism / problem / proposed change / size·risk·impact / affected
  files (clickable paths). Set status `awaiting-batch`.
- In the `summary`, tell the human the contract in plain Russian: pick «Делаем»/«Пропускаем» per
  feature (or type a free-form note like «делаем, но без X»), then **«Отправить»** to record the choice,
  then **«Утвердить план»** to dispatch the picked ones. State the defaults explicitly: **нет ответа =
  Пропускаем**, and the order **Submit → Approve** is required (the draft is not readable before submit).
- Park at the checkpoint and wait (see `feedback-loop.md`). On a new `submissions/<n>.json`: read every
  comment/answer, refine the cards if the human pushed back (bump `iteration`, re-park), and write a
  short `replies.json` entry per item keyed by `feat-K`. A free-form `answer.text` outside the options
  is valid (ADR-0008) — read it as a refinement to that feature's brief.
- When the human clicks **«Утвердить план»** (an `approve-plan` signal): take the **latest** submission,
  collect every `feat-K` whose answer is «Делаем» (or a free-form "делаем…"). Treat any `feat-K` with no
  answer as **Пропускаем**. Record the picked ids in `state.json.selected[]`, and advance to DISPATCH.
- In headless/eval mode: skip waiting; auto-pick the top-K (or apply any pre-seeded submissions);
  auto-approve.

## 5. DISPATCH (autonomous)

Goal: seed each picked feature as a standalone `/feature` run in its own git worktree, then hand the
launch to the human.

- The exact seed sequence is in `consensus.md` §DISPATCH (the per-feature steps: fresh slug →
  `worktree.py add` → `baseCommit` in the worktree → read-modify-write `state.json` at
  `EXPLORE`/`working` → seed `brief.md`/`dashboard.json`/`index.html` → hub picks it up). It also lists
  exactly what **not** to seed.
- For each seeded feature, append a `dispatched[]` entry to this task's `state.json`
  (`{slug, featId, worktreePath, branch, baseCommit, dashboardUrl}`).
- Advance to DONE.

## 6. DONE

- Write a final summary into `dashboard.json`: a card per dispatched feature (slug / title / prism) with
  a link to its own dashboard (`/?slug=<feat-slug>`), plus a link to the hub (`/hub`), plus the explicit
  launch instruction per feature: `cd <worktreePath> && /feature`. Tell the human in chat the same:
  these runs are seeded and waiting — open each worktree and start `/feature` there (it resumes from the
  seeded `state.json`, skipping INTAKE).
- Spawn `wf-documenter` to grow `docs/knowledge/` (see `knowledge-guide.md`): the task-log entry, any
  ADR for a notable decision, and the index refresh. It is a peer step, not an afterthought.
- Set `phase: "DONE"` in `state.json` and set the dashboard status appropriately. Point the human at the
  dashboard, the hub, and the updated knowledge base.
